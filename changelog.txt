Version: 2.0.2
  Features:
    - Added small "x" button to top right of frame
  Fixes:
    - Fixed broken name and missing tooltip of controls entry in controls settings.
    - Changed name of panel to "Screenshot Toolkit Panel"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.1
  Optimizations:
    - Added instructions how to select an area in a tooltip
    - Added info-icons to important tooltips
    - Prepared localization
    - Reverted order of changelogs so that the newest are on top
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.0
  Features:
    - There is a gui now! Weeeee!
    - Screenshots of selected areas are now possible using the new gui, as requested by Ida-Marie. For limitations please have a look at the FAQ and mod description on the mod portal.
  Optimizations:
    - The code of the mod was completely restructured and blew up completely. Now it is roughly 5x its former size. If this now causes new instabilities please notify me so on the mod portal. I will watch it thoroughly for the following days.
  Other:
    - Changed the mod icon. Yes, I really like skulls.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.5
  Other:
    - 1.1 didn't break anything, adjusted the compatible game version.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.4
  Fixes:
    - Fixed issue of "there are still screenshots to be done" warning being thrown when no new screenshot is registered and skipped. Also, adjusted text slightly
  Other:
    - Changed mod thumbnail to this masterpiece. I made a lot of people look at it. I love it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.3
  Features:
    - Changed the "Increased Splitting" from being a tickbox to being a dropdown of different increase factors. Changed Tooltip accordingly.
  Other:
    - Changed Mod description to better represent what it is doing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.2
  Fixes:
    - Zoom level is now capped at 32. Any zoom level over 32 would crash the game due to the engine limiting it. And tbh, any higher zoom level would zoom everything out so far one couldn't identify anything anyways. The player will be warned when this limit is hit.
  Other:
    - Increased factorio version from 0.18 to 1.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.1
  Optimizations:
    - Improved splitting ratios after looking at the math of it and seeing some potential for it
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
  Features:
    - Added possibility to do the screenshot over several ticks, with subscreenshots being taken based on the base size. This prevents freezeframes on medium or bigger bases.
    - Split screenshots are saved in a separate folder called "split"
    - Added "enable single tick screenshot" setting. This is false by default.
    - Added "increased splitting" setting. This is false by default.
    - If the script is not done with all screenshots after one minute there will be a warning and the screenshot is skipped. For more information have a look at the "increased splitting" setting tooltip.
  Fixes:
    - Fixed typo in "Enable debug?" setting tooltip
  Other:
    - Currently there is no way to stitch the multiscreenshots together. This will be the next step.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.5
  Features:
    - Added "enable debug" setting. This enables verbose logging, which can slow the game down significantly. Use this if, and only if, you want to create a log for a bugreport.
  Fixes:
    - Fixed issue with settings sometimes not being loaded (I hope at least, Im going crazy here, not gonna lie (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ )
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.4
  Fixes:
    - Fixed issue with screenshots being saved in the wrong folder
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.3
  Optimizations:
    - On building large blueprints there should be no more freeze for a few frames, as the limits for new screenshots are now only calculated once there was something built that leaves the boundaries of the current limits.
  Fixes:
    - Fixed issue with last fix causing desyncs in multiplayer. Sry, but factorio is really unfriendly in that regard :/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.2
  Fixes:
    - Fixed issue with loading properly on mod or base game version change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.1
  Features:
    - Zoom is now adjusted softer. Instead of doing 1/(2^n) it is now 1/n. Before the image size was quadrupled every adjustment.
  Fixes:
    - Fixed crashes occuring on loading the script on a fresh map.
    - Fixed crashes on "sandbox" gametype being caused by player character missing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
