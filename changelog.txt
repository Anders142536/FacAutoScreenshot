Version: 1.0.1
  Features:
    - Zoom is now adjusted softer. Instead of doing 1/(2^n) it is now 1/n. Before the image size was quadrupled every adjustment.

    - Fixed crashes occuring on loading the script on a fresh map.
    - Fixed crashes on "sandbox" gametype being caused by player character missing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Fixes:
    - Fixed issue with loading properly on mod or base game version change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.3
  Optimizations:
    - On building large blueprints there should be no more freeze for a few frames, as the limits for new screenshots are now only calculated once there was something built that leaves the boundaries of the current limits.
  Fixes:
    - Fixed issue with last fix causing desyncs in multiplayer. Sry, but factorio is really unfriendly in that regard :/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.4
  Fixes:
    - Fixed issue with screenshots being saved in the wrong folder
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.5
  Features:
    - Added "enable debug" setting. This enables verbose logging, which can slow the game down significantly. Use this if, and only if, you want to create a log for a bugreport.
  Fixes:
    - Fixed issue with settings sometimes not being loaded (I hope at least, Im going crazy here, not gonna lie (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ )
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
  Features:
    - Added possibility to do the screenshot over several ticks, with subscreenshots being taken based on the base size. This prevents freezeframes on medium or bigger bases.
    - Split screenshots are saved in a separate folder called "split"
    - Added "enable single tick screenshot" setting. This is false by default.
    - Added "increased splitting" setting. This is false by default.
    - If the script is not done with all screenshots after one minute there will be a warning and the screenshot is skipped. For more information have a look at the "increased splitting" setting tooltip.
  Fixes:
    - Fixed typo in "Enable debug?" setting tooltip
  Other:
    - Currently there is no way to stitch the multiscreenshots together. This will be the next step.
