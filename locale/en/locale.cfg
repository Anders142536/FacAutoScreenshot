[mod-setting-description]
FAS-do-screenshot=If ticked, the script will do a screenshot
FAS-Screenshot-interval=Time between screenshots in minutes
FAS-Resolution=Resolution to take the screenshots in
FAS-enable-debug=Enables verbose logging. On larger bases this can cause heavy framedrops and relatively huge log files. Enable this if, and only if, you want to report a bug with the script.
FAS-increased-splitting=Increases splitting of screenshots by a factor of 4. Use this if your system is slow and taking screenshots significantly lowers your UPS count. Also, the time difference between the first and the last screenshot is 4 times longer.\n\nScreenshots are taken per player (one after the other, in queue), so if your base is huge and there are several players connected this may cause the issue that the script is not done with all screenshots before one minute has passed and new screenshots are to be taken. If that happens you will get a warning in the chat and the screenshot will be simply skipped.\n\nTimes it takes for *one* screenshot to be taken on the biggest basesize:\n 1:  256 ticks /  ~4 s\n 4: 1024 ticks / ~ 17 s\n16: 4096 ticks / 1m 8s\n64: 65536 ticks / 18m 16s
FAS-single-screenshot=Enables single tick screenshots. This makes the game do the screenshot in a single file, but also in a single tick. The game will freeze until the screenshot is done. This will not be noticeable on smaller bases, but on medium or bigger bases there can be freeze frames of several seconds.\n\nIf you do not enable this the game will take several, smaller screenshots, based on base size. Also, you will need my stitcher program or similar software to stitch the smaller screenshots back together.
